## ✨ About This Project

This is the official landing page for **Bauhaus UI**, presenting the philosophy, inspiration, and components of the library. Built with Astro and using the Bauhaus UI components themselves.

### Why Bauhaus?

The Bauhaus school (1919-1933) revolutionized modern design with a simple philosophy: **form follows function**. This library brings those principles to digital interfaces:

- 🔷 **Pure Geometry** — Circles, squares, triangles as visual foundation
- 🎨 **Primary Colors** — Red, blue, yellow + neutrals
- 📐 **Rational Typography** — Clean, legible, hierarchical
- 🧱 **Modularity** — Components designed to work in harmony

## 👩‍💻 About the Author

**Jessica Borda** — Frontend Developer & Architect

As an architect turned frontend developer, I bring a unique perspective to UI design. My background in architecture taught me to balance aesthetics with functionality, to plan, structure, and pay attention to technical details. This library is the bridge between my two worlds: architecture and digital design.
